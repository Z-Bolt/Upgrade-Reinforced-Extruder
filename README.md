# Small upgrade of the extruder.

This version of extruder is reinforced by aluminium parts. Also extruder is redesined for 8mm brass extruder drive gear (Photo 1-75mm-Brass-Extruderl-Drive-Gear.jpg).

You can find printed parts in STL folder. Source files of STLs and aluminium parts in SRC folder.

Assembling process is very simular with classic extruder, you will also need 4 additional M3x12 flat head screws. 

Enjoy!
